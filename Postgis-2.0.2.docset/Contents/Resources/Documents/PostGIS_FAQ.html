        slower than they are on geometry.  If
		 you use geography -- you don't need to learn much about planar coordinate systems. Geography is generally best
		 if all you care about is measuring distances and lengths and you have data from all over the world.
		 Geometry data type is an older data type that has many more functions supporting it, enjoys greater support from third party tools,
		 and operations on it are generally faster -- sometimes as much as 10 fold faster for larger geometries.
		 Geometry is best if you are pretty comfortable with spatial reference systems or you are dealing with localized data
		  where all your data fits in a single <a href="using_postgis_dbmanagement.html#spatial_ref_sys" title="4.3.1. The SPATIAL_REF_SYS Table and Spatial Reference Systems">spatial reference system (SRID)</a>, or you need to do a lot of spatial processing.
		  Note: It is fairly easy to do one-off conversions between the two types to gain the benefits of each.

		For geometry: Connect to your database with
        <code class="filename">psql</code> and try the following SQL:</p><pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE gtest ( ID int4, NAME varchar(20) );
SELECT AddGeometryColumn('', 'gtest','geom',-1,'LINESTRING',2);</pre><p>If the geometry column addition fails, you probably have not

        insert statement. The GIS object itself is formatted using the OpenGIS
        Consortium "well-known text" format:</p><pre class="programlisting">INSERT INTO gtest (ID, NAME, GEOM)

        combination of return values, functions, and boolean tests.</p><p>For spatial queries, there are two issues that are important to
        keep in mind while constructing your query: is there a spatial index
        you can make use of; and, are you doing expensive calculations on a
        large number of geometries.</p><p>In general, you will want to use the "intersects operator"
        (&amp;&amp;) which tests whether the bounding boxes of features

        operator will make use of this. This can make queries much much
        faster.</p><p>You will also make use of spatial functions, such as Distance(),
        ST_Intersects(), ST_Contains() and ST_Within(), among others, to
        narrow down the results of your search. Most spatial queries include
        both an indexed test and a spatial function test. The index test
        serves to limit the number of return tuples to only tuples that
